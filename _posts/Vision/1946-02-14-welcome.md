## Why Blogging

因为我行呀

## Helloworld（不知道写什么）

最初的"hello, world"打印内容有个标准，即全小写，有逗号，逗号后空一格，且无感叹号。不过沿用至今，完全遵循传统标准形式的反而很少出现。

```
echo "hello, world\n";
```php

## 保留 Jekyll 第一篇文档（TL;DR;）

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
